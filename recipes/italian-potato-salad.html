      <h2>Patate Prezzemolate (Italian Potato Salad)</h2>
      <p style="width: 50%">
        This is a classic Italian potato salad that can be found on tables from
        the north to the south. Meaning "parsley potatoes", you'll find Patate
        Prezzemolate everywhere in Italy: formal luncheons, family
        get-togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in school cafeterias. Buon
        appetito!

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring
          to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10
          minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to
          handle.
        </li>
        <li>
          While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white
          wine vinegar together in a small bowl. Add garlic and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine
          potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season
          with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss,
          taking care not to break the potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right
          before serving
        </li>
